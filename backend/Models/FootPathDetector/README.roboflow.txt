The dataset includes 599 images.
Footpath are annotated in PNG Masks For Semantic Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -3 and +3 degrees
* Random shear of between -3째 to +3째 horizontally and -3째 to +3째 vertically
